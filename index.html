    <section><h2>Gandalf vs Dumbledore: A Style Guide</h2>
        <article>
            <div id="dumbledore">
                <div>
                    <h4>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore</h4>
                    <p>Young Dumbledore clearly had that qu'est-ce que c'est in the 1920's and 1930's. Trim beard and fresh haircut? Check. Double-breasted suit? Check. A certain Jude Law look about him? Check. This wizard was on the cover of 'Wands and Robes' magazine three (three!!) times! How is this even a real competition? Dumbledore came to Hogwarts oozing with 'the juice'. Could it really be so open and closed?</p>
                    <h4>Tragedy in the UK</h4>
                    <p>Sometime between 1945 and his re-introduction in the mid-1990's, something terrible happened.. Dumbledore transformed from a fresh, styling young man into your Grandpa's hoarder neighbor who forgets to cut his fingernails and may or may not pee on newspapers. Huh?! What?! What happened?? How? When? All great questions that we will never have the answers to.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Gandalf the Grey</h4>
                    <p>Gandalf the Grey, or <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Gandalf" target="_blank">Ol√≥rin</a> as he was known in his youth, was always humble and simple. He wore basic grey robes and never made a fuss about looking fresh. He ran around with Hobbits and Dwarves, Men and Elves like he just walked out in his 'home office' robes. For many years, he was no match for Dumbledore.</p>
                    <h4>Hallelujah, he has returned!</h4>
                    <p>It was only after he defeated the Balrog did Gandalf return with a healthy pinch of S-T-Y-L-E! He went from Plain Jane to Mr. Steal Your Grandma! Fresh dressed in crisp white, head to toe with the horse to match!! What an unbelievable transformation!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div id="conclusion">
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>In their youth, Dumbledore wins every time. The classic clean cut look with skills to back it put him on top of the podium. But in their old age, he slips up. He forgets drip like that takes upkeep. Enter Gandalf the White. And my God what an entrance. He's like the finest Middle Earth mead, only getting better with age.</p>
