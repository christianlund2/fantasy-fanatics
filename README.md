5 Recipe
- The recipe section features a movie marathon feast to follow along with, giving menu items and times to serve. (Original Trilogy only, sorry Hobbit fans).
- This is a fun and interesting idea to supplement a popular movie trilogy to watch. The foods call to the types of food from the films, providing a sense of connection.

## Testing
- This project was built in Google Chrome, mostly in GitPod but some in CodePen. It was tested in Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari browsers and on mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktop monitors. 
- The NAV elements all work as intended, jumping to the correct section of the webpge. The quiz interactions all work (10/10 for Star Wars *is* the correct answer). The links to social media open in a new tab to the correct web address. 

One consideration I did not anticipate was viewing on ultra-wide PC monitors.
